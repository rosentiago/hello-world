Learning Git

Hello, I'm Mary Rose E. Santiago.
I love Web Development since High School.
I'm experienced in using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP in order to create WordPress Themes.

I love reading mangas and books, but right now, I'm into fanfictions as well.
Specially if my favorite character died. I'll be hunting for fanfictions where they managed to stay alive
